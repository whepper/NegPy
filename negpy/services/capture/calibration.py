"""Per-channel ETTR exposure auto-calibration (ported from TriRGB's approach).

For a film stock, meter the clear film base inside a user-drawn ROI and solve **one camera
shutter shared across R/G/B** plus a per-channel Scanlight LED level so each channel's base
sits just below clipping ("expose to the right"). One probe per channel estimates its
response; the shared shutter is chosen so the *dimmest* channel reaches target within the LED
range (the RGB channels differ by ~1 stop — orange mask minus the Scanlight's per-channel LED
balance — well inside the LED's ~2.7-stop range). Then each channel's LED is solved + verified
+ one proportional trim, with a clip guard (pull the LED down) and, if the whole set doesn't
fit the LED window, a shared-shutter escalation. Keeping the shutter constant makes presets a
single shutter + three LED levels. The black level is the dark-frame median (robust to hot
pixels). Hardware-free: light, camera, and a `demosaic` callable are injected.
