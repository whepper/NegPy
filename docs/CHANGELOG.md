# Change Log

## 0.17.0

- Improved default conversion/normalization process, now out-of-the-box results should be better & more natural.
- Camera white balance is now applied by default — images open with the camera's as-shot WB for a balanced starting point.
- Replaced the "Camera WB" toggle with a "Linear RAW" button. Enable it to decode RAW files with neutral (1,1,1,1) multipliers, bypassing the camera WB.
- Added **Vignette effect**: new Finishing sidebar section with Strength and Size sliders. Applies a radial cosine-falloff vignette post-crop in both CPU and GPU pipelines. Negative strength darkens edges, positive brightens them.
- Moved **border controls** from the Export section to the new Finishing section. Border Width is now a slider. Old workspace files with border settings are automatically migrated.
- Increased range of **Analysis buffer** slider.
- Better error recovery in edge cases (swapchain resizing, invalid crop ratios).
- Config deserialization now warns on unknown keys — old workspace files with renamed settings won't silently lose data.
- More tests for GPU-CPU feature parity.
- Removed some dependencies that were not used.
- Added test coverage reporting to CI.
- UI refinements.

## 0.16.0

- Fix: rendering crash on some DNG and TIFF files at extreme D-Range Clip values (`kth out of bounds` error from `np.percentile` on float32 arrays.
- Fix: NaN/inf pixels in loaded images no longer propagate into normalization bounds.
- Fix: color cast on some files (cr3, raf) files.
- Fix: unsupported RAW files now show a clear error in the status bar instead of crashing.
- Updated rawpy/libraw: fixes loading of Panasonic Lumix .RW2 files from newer camera models.
- Updated many other dependencies.

**Dropped intel mac support due to lack of support for newer rawpy/libraw!**

## 0.15.0

- Add customizable slider shortcuts for all controls @alessandrv
- Fix: preview display issues (Windows) @alessandrv
- Fix: JPEG and TIFF scans now correctly linearized from sRGB before processing — density curves and color response now physically accurate for scanned negatives.
- Fix: GPU pipeline failures now log a full stack trace instead of a single-line message, making hardware acceleration issues diagnosable.
- Fix: GPU readback buffer correctly unmapped on error, preventing render failures after a hardware exception.
- UX: Make UI more subdued, replace intensive reds with subtle greys.

## 0.14.2

- Fix regression: loading monochrome DNG files no longer crashes the app (segfault in display conversion and pixel readout).

## 0.14.1

- Added **`override.toml`**: a config file in `Documents/NegPy/` (created on first run) for forcing GPU backend, Qt rendering, texture size cap, and more — without touching the app. See [Troubleshooting](../README.md#-troubleshooting) for details.
- Fix: **D-Range Clip** slider now uses a logarithmic scale for much finer control at low values.
- Fix: **Autocrop Offset** maximum raised to 100, allowing larger offsets on wide-border scans.
- Fix: 16-bit colour TIFF exports now use a proper 16-bit ICC colour transform.
- Fix: copy-pasted edits not persisting without additional manual change or explicit "Save".
- UX: Added empty-state overlay on the canvas when no image is loaded.
- Performance & stability improvements.

## 0.14.0

- Added **Split Toning**: independent shadow and highlight color tinting with hue (0–360°) and strength controls. Works on both color and B&W scans. Applied in Lab space — luminance is preserved exactly.
- **Per-section reset buttons**: each collapsible sidebar section header now has a reset button to restore that section's defaults without touching other settings.
- **Canvas background color**: three swatch buttons in the toolbar (Black / Dark Grey / Mid Grey) to set the viewport background.
- **Keyboard shortcut overlay**: press `?` to open a modal reference of all shortcuts.
- **Persistent UI preferences**: HQ preview toggle, canvas background color, auto dust removal default, and ICC profile settings (path, direction, apply-to-export) now survive app restarts.
- **Slider improvements**: sliders now show a tick mark at the default position; numeric units (px, °) displayed on relevant sliders; drag the slider label horizontally to scrub its value (hold Shift for fine control, Ctrl for coarse).
- **Cursor pixel readout**: hovering over the canvas shows the pixel's RGB and Lab values in the status bar.
- **Right click menu**: added as quicker way to access some tools/functions when right-clickign on image preview.
- Improved normalization: simplified per-channel floor analysis for more consistent results across different film stocks.
- Increased CMY white balance range for stronger correction capability.
- Toning: Selenium & Sepia sliders now hidden in color mode; Paper Profile section moved below toning controls with a clear label.
- Lab: color-only sliders (Separation, Saturation, Vibrance, Denoise) now hidden in B&W mode instead of greyed out.
- Exposure: Global / Shadows / Highlights region selector replaced with three toggle buttons; CMY label colors shift subtly per region for visual context.
- Collapsible sidebar sections now show a red dot indicator when they contain non-default values.
- Added info tooltips to many sliders.
- Many small UI refinements.
- GPU acceleration failure now shown as a status message instead of silently falling back to CPU.
- Stability: fixed GPU staging buffer leak on device loss/OOM; fixed dangling thread on app quit; thumbnail failures now surface as status bar errors.

## 0.13.2

- Fix regression: Changing camera wb, crop ratio, crop offset, manual crop, or resetting crop now forces normalization bounds re-analysis.
- Fix: Process mode change now correctly clears both floor and ceiling bounds (previously only ceiling was cleared).
- Fix: Corrupted RAW files (partial data errors) no longer crash the loader — app falls back gracefully.
- Updated dependencies: PyQt6 6.11.0, wgpu 0.31.0. (might help crashes with newer nvidia drivers)

## 0.13.1

- Fix: Pick WB not updating magenta & yellow sliders

## 0.13.0

- Added *D-Range Clip* slider for controlling the bounds of normalization process.
- Added *Sort Order* settings for contact sheet UI section (sort by name or date, ascending/descending).
- Added *HQ* toggle for viewport preview (renders preview in full resolution).

- Overall performance & stability improvements.
- Make "Pick WB" tool more predictable by averaging 8x8 area instead of sampling simple pixel.
- Fix: Linux appimage crashing on some distros.
- Fix: Border added via export menu being picked up by histogram calculation.
- Fix: mouse wheel accidentally changing sliders and dropdowns when scrolling the sidebar.
- Fix: Crash when using the Clear button to remove all files from the session.

## 0.12.0

- Added functionality to reset slider on double click (slider iteself, not only label).
- Added ability to "unzoom" for easier cropping.

## 0.11.0

- Improved normalization/autoexposure.
  - More dynamic range.
  - More neutral defaults.
  - Improved batch analysis (more aggressive outlier detection).
- Streamlined controls
  - Combined shadows+toe & highlights+shoulder sliders
- Added glow & halation effects sliders to Lab section.


## 0.10.1

- Optimized database writes to prevent stuttering during active slider movement.
- Fixed manual crop tool not being restricted to image border.
- Apply/sync export settings to all loaded files by default when using "Export All" button.

## 0.10.0

- Added **Zoom & Pan** for preview:
    - Useful for cleaning dust :)
    - Mouse wheel to zoom (up to 400%).
    - left-click (or middle click when using tools like spot healing brush) drag to pan.
    - Discrete zoom slider in the toolbar.
- Added **Persistent Undo/Redo**:
    - Standard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y).
    - Stores up to 100 steps per file in local SQLite database.
    - History survives app restarts and file switching.
    - Track number of edits on image overlay (lower left corner)
      - Also track number of heal spots in retouch toolbar section.
- Packaged some additional requirements in Linux appimage for easier (I hope) running on debian-derived distros.
- **Fixed(?) UI rendering issues on Windows**

NOTE: due to some backend changes in storing the edits you might get weird colors on your previously edited photos. Reset should get rid of that. Nuclear option is deleting `edits.db` and `settings.db` from NegPy folder in your Documents.
