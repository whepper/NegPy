# NegPy User Guide

## 1. Core Workflow

NegPy follows a non-destructive pipeline:
1.  **Import**: Add files to your session.
2.  **Process**: Choose your film mode and perform roll-wide normalization.
3.  **Exposure**: Fine-tune the density, grade, and characteristic curve (Sigmoid).
4.  **Lab**: Apply local contrast (CLAHE), sharpening, and color enhancements.
5.  **Export**: Save your results as high-quality JPEG or TIFF.

## 2. Process Panel
The foundation of your edit.

*   **Process Mode**: Select between `C41 Negative`, `B&W Negative`, and `E6 (Positive)`.
*   **Analysis Buffer**: Adjusts the safety margin for auto-exposure. Increase if your scans have a lot of space around the actual image.
*   **D-Range Clip**: Narrows the statistical percentile range used to detect black and white points. Higher values clip more extreme pixels before calculating bounds, which can help with very dense or fogged negatives where outlier pixels would otherwise skew the normalization.
*   **White/Black Point Offset**: Manually shift the auto-normalization boundaries for more or less contrast.
*   **Normalize (E6 only)**: Automatically stretches the histogram for positive film. Useful for faded/expired slides.
*   **Batch Analysis**: Analyzes all loaded files to find a consistent "Roll Average" baseline. Calculates average density and color balance for the entire roll (after discarding outliers).
*   **Use Roll Average**: Toggles between local (per-image) and roll-wide exposure normalization.

## 3. Exposure Panel
Shaping the light and color.

*   **Regional CMY (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow)**: 
    *   **Global**: Adjusts the overall white balance.
    *   **Shadows/Highlights**: Applies targeted color shifts to specific regions of the density curve.
*   **Pick WB**: Select a neutral area in the image to automatically calculate white balance shifts.
*   **Linear RAW**: Disables the camera white balance and decodes the RAW file with neutral multipliers. When off (default), the camera's as-shot white balance is applied automatically, giving you a balanced starting point. Turn on if you prefer to work from completely neutral (1,1,1,1) RAW data.
*   **Density**: Controls the overall brightness, simulating exposure time in an analog darkroom. Lower values = brighter.
*   **Grade**: Controls the contrast, simulating different paper grades.
*   **Sigmoid Curve (Toe/Shoulder)**:

    *   **Toe**: Controls how shadows transition to black. Positive values add density to the shadow region.
    *   **Shoulder**: Controls how highlights transition to white. Positive values compress the highlights for a gentler roll-off.
    *   **Width**: Controls how broadly each transition region is applied.

## 4. Lab Panel
Final polish and detail.

*   **Separation**: Enhances color distinction by applying a separation matrix.
*   **Chroma Denoise**: Selectively reduces color noise in shadow areas using a Gaussian LAB pass.
*   **Saturation**: Basic saturation boost or reduction.
*   **Vibrance**: Smart saturation that targets muted colors more than vibrant ones.
*   **CLAHE**: (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) provides local contrast enhancement without over-blowing highlights.
*   **Sharpening**: L-channel Unsharp Masking for crisp details without introducing color halos.
*   **Glow**: Simulates lens bloom. Bright highlights scatter light equally across all channels, softening edges and giving a dreamy quality.
*   **Halation**: Simulates the red glow caused by light scattering back through the film base. Affects only highlights and is strongly red-dominant, as in real film halation.

---

## 5. Retouch Panel
Cleanup and dust removal.

*   **Auto Dust**: Automatically detects and removes small particles based on a density threshold.
*   **Heal Tool**: Manual dust removal. Toggle the tool, then click on dust spots in the preview.
*   **Brush Size**: Controls the radius of the manual healing tool.
*   **Undo Last / Clear All**: Manage your manual retouching spots.

---

## 6. Export Panel
Delivering the final image.

*   **Format**: Choose between compressed `JPEG` or high-bit-depth `TIFF`.
*   **Color Space**: Standard `sRGB`, `Adobe RGB`, `Greyscale` (for true B&W) and some others.
*   **Resolution**: Export at `Original` RAW resolution or resize to a specific print size (cm) and DPI.
*   **Border**: Add a procedural border with custom width and color.
*   **Batch Export**: Process and save all loaded files using current or individual settings.

## 7. Startup Override (`override.toml`)

If NegPy crashes on launch or has rendering glitches, you can force specific backend settings without touching code. On first run, NegPy creates `Documents/NegPy/override.toml` with defaults for your OS. Edit it and restart the app.

**Key settings:**

| Setting | Values | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `rendering.backend` | `"auto"`, `"vulkan"`, `"dx12"`, `"metal"`, `"cpu"` | GPU backend for image processing. `"cpu"` disables GPU entirely. |
| `display.qt_rhi_backend` | `"auto"`, `"vulkan"`, `"d3d12"`, `"metal"`, `"opengl"`, `"software"` | Qt UI rendering backend. |
| `display.qt_platform` | `"auto"`, `"xcb"`, `"wayland"` | Window system plugin (Linux only). |
| `performance.max_texture_size` | `"auto"` or a number, e.g. `4096` | Caps GPU texture size — reduce if you see out-of-memory errors on low-VRAM cards. |
| `performance.force_hq_preview` | `true` / `false` (or absent) | Overrides the saved HQ preview toggle. |
| `logging.level` | `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"error"` | Controls log verbosity. Use `"debug"` when reporting issues. |

**Common fixes:**

*   **App crashes immediately on Linux** → try `backend = "cpu"` or `qt_rhi_backend = "opengl"`.
*   **Black/blank preview on Windows** → try `backend = "dx12"` or `qt_rhi_backend = "software"`.
*   **Wayland rendering issues** → set `qt_platform = "xcb"` to force X11.
*   **GPU out-of-memory during export** → set `max_texture_size = 4096`.

## Additional Info
*   **Hardware Acceleration**: NegPy uses your GPU for near-instant previews & responsive sliders with exceptions of *Process* section (analysis buffer, white/black point offset, normalize) which use CPU for calculations.
*   **Roll Management**: Save your Batch Analysis as a "Roll" to apply the same look to future sessions with the same film stock.
*   **Database**: All edits live in a local SQLite database, keyed by file hash. You can move or rename files without losing your work.
*   **Edits**: Edits are saved to db on export/file change or when you explicitly save them. If you close the app without saving, your edits/settings will be lost.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: [see here](KEYBOARD.md)
*   **Templating**: [see here](TEMPLATING.md)
*   **Pipeline**: [see here](PIPELINE.md)
