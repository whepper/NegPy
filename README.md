**NegPy** is a tool for processing film negatives. I built it because I wanted something made specifically for film scans that goes beyond a simple inversion tool. It simulates how film and photographic paper work but also throws in some lab-scanner conveniences.

It is built with **Python**, running natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## ✨ Features

*   **No Camera Profiles**: It doesn't use camera profiles or ask you to color-pick the border. It uses math to neutralize the orange mask based on channel sensitometry.
*   **Positive/Slide Support**: A dedicated **E-6 mode** for processing slide film with optional normalization to save expired or faded film.
*   **Film Physics**: It models the **H&D Characteristic Curve** of photographic material using a Logistic Sigmoid function instead of doing simple linear inversion.
*   **Batch Normalization**: Perform bounds analysis for all loaded files and apply averaged settings to all.
*   **GPU Acceleration**: Real-time processing and export rendering using Vulkan/Metal.
*   **Dust Removal**: Automatic and manual healing tools with grain synthesis to keep scans clean without looking plastic.
*   **File Support**: Supports standard RAWs/TIFFs, and specialized formats like Kodak Pakon scanner raw files.
*   **Non-destructive**: original files are never touched; edits are stored as recipes.
*   **Keyboard Shortcuts**: [see here](docs/KEYBOARD.md)
*   **Database**: All edits live in a local SQLite database, keyed by file hash. You can move or rename files without losing your work.
*   **Persistent Undo/Redo**: Up to 100 edits saved in local db. Persistent across sessions.
*   **Print Ready**: Export module designed for printing, featuring border controls, ICC soft-proofing, and [dynamic filename templating](docs/TEMPLATING.md).

### 🧪 How it works

[📖 Read about the math and the pipeline here](docs/PIPELINE.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Download
Grab the latest release for your OS from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/marcinz606/NegPy/releases)**.

#### **🐧 Linux**
I provide an `.AppImage`. Make it executable using `chmod +x` and It should just work.

You can also clone the repo and build it yourself, instruction here: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

#### **🛡️ Unsigned Software Warning**
Since this is a free hobby project, I don't pay Apple or Microsoft ransom for their developer certificates. You'll get a scary warning the first time you run it.

**🍎 MacOS**:
1.  Double click `.dmg` file & drag the app to `/Applications`.
2.  Open Terminal and run: `xattr -cr /Applications/NegPy.app` (this gets rid of the warning).
3.  Launch it.

**🪟 Windows**:
1. Run the installer (ignore the warnings)
2. Start the app and click through the warnings.

## 📂 Data Location
Everything lives in your `Documents/NegPy` folder:
*   `edits.db`: Your edits.
*   `settings.db`: Global settings like last used export settings or preview size.
*   `cache/`: Thumbnails (safe to delete).
*   `export/`: Default export location.
*   `icc/`: Drop your paper/printer profiles here.
*   `override.toml`: Startup overrides — see [Troubleshooting / override.toml](#troubleshooting) below.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If NegPy crashes on startup or has rendering issues, edit `Documents/NegPy/override.toml`. It is created automatically on first run with sensible defaults for your OS.

```toml
[rendering]
# Options: "auto", "vulkan" (Linux/Win), "dx12" (Win), "metal" (macOS), "cpu"
backend = "vulkan"

[display]
# Qt scene-graph backend. Options: "auto", "vulkan", "d3d12", "metal", "opengl", "software"
qt_rhi_backend = "auto"

# Window system plugin (Linux only). Options: "auto", "xcb", "wayland"
qt_platform = "auto"

[performance]
# Cap GPU texture size in pixels — useful on low-VRAM cards. "auto" = no limit.
max_texture_size = "auto"

# Force HQ preview on/off. Uncomment to override saved preference.
# force_hq_preview = false

[logging]
# "debug", "info", "warning", "error"
level = "info"
```

Setting `backend = "cpu"` disables GPU acceleration entirely — useful if the GPU backend crashes on your hardware.
